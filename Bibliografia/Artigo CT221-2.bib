	shorttitle = {Chapter 9 - The Big Data and Artificial Intelligence},
	abstract = {The rapid digital transformation of our societies is increasing the gap between the speed of technological change and the slow pace of the policy cycle. We are always playing catch up rather than being able to guide the processes. In this chapter we pose the question: how can we leverage {AI} and Big Data to govern with the digital transformation, in addition to shaping the governance of digital transformation? What would governing with {AI} and Big Data look like? To address these questions, we explore the potential use of Big Data and {AI} to modernise the entire policy cycle, from anticipation to design, implementation, monitoring and assessment. We show in particular how the concept of profiling can be applied to official statistics and other data sources to develop policy interventions targeted to the groups and areas needing them most. This form of “personalised” policy recognises the need to put individuals at the centre of the policy debate, addressing their needs, expectations and perceptions.},

	title = {Stock market prediction using an improved training algorithm of neural network},
	doi = {10.1109/ICECTE.2016.7879611},
	abstract = {Predicting closing stock price accurately is an challenging task. Computer aided systems have been proved to be helpful tool for stock prediction such as Artificial Neural Net-work({ANN}), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System ({ANFIS}) etc. Latest research works prove that Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System shows better results than Neural Network for stock prediction. In this paper, an improved Levenberg Marquardt({LM}) training algorithm of artificial neural network has been proposed. Improved Levenberg Marquardt algorithm of neural network can predict the possible day-end closing stock price with less memory and time needed, provided previous historical stock market data of Dhaka Stock Exchange such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, total share traded. Morever, improved {LM} algorithm can predict day-end stock price with 53\% less error than {ANFIS} and traditional {LM} algorithm. It also requires 30\% less time, 54\% less memory than traditional {LM} and 47\% less time, 59\% less memory than {ANFIS}.},
